I recently “finished” Ghost of Tsushima [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVknSjv5hAFJSWy2rEHngAjwUgy-YfwLc). What a game. 

(By finishing on Youtube, I mean playing on the second screen as background in my leisure time. This way, I don't have to put in 20 to 30 hours grinding to enjoy the content of a game. I'm sure there are a lot of people doing this already. Just to make sure everyone knows what I'm talking about.)
