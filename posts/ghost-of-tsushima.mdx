I recently “finished” Ghost of Tsushima [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVknSjv5hAFJSWy2rEHngAjwUgy-YfwLc). What a game. [The two Mongol invasions of Japan](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mongol_invasions_of_Japan) is significant historic events that are only briefly mentioned in the history textbooks outside Japan AFAIK. This game prompted me to do some research and learn more about them. This alone is already worth the (metaphorical) ticket.

(By finishing on Youtube, I mean playing on the second screen as background in my leisure time. This way, I don't have to put in 20 to 30 hours grinding to enjoy the content of a game. I'm sure there are a lot of people doing this already. Just to make sure everyone knows what I'm talking about.)

Of all that I've learned, firstly, is that about half of the first invasion (on which this game is based) had about 30,000 invading soilders. About half of them are Korean, the other half of them consists of people from the northern part of the modern China conquered by the Mongolian. Exactly how many Mongolians are in the invading army is unclear. So to be precise, the samurais in Tsushima is not exactly fighting Mongolians, but the people from in the Mongol empire.

Secondly, the Tsushima was taken rather easily by the Mongol. It took only a few day to secure the entire island. So the game's antagonist Khotun Khan's obsession to turn Lord Shimura is really contrived in this perspective. His force was strong enough to crush any local resistance. And if he really had studied the Japanese culture at that time, he should've realized that turning a samurai is nearly impossible. In the end he only successfully turned the straw hat ronins. The game's writer is also telling us what a fool he was.

The way of ghost adopted by the protagonist sounds a lot like [the way of ninja](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ninja). However, ninjas were not widely used by Japanese until 15th century, so it's explainable why the protagonist was treated as a pagan to the Japanese culture. 

I think the protagonist action is entirely justifiable. If you play dirty, I'll also play dirty. Otherwise you just become a fool being taken advantages of. I don't mean it by the an-eye-for-an-eye way, as extremely as in “you kill my children, then I kill your children”, but rather as in “you kill my children, so I'll never consider you as a honorable person, nor will I ever sign any deals with you.” In the game, the Mogol soilders kill Japanese soilders and civilians with no honr, so poisoning them with no honor seems perfectly fine to me.
