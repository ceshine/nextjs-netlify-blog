I finally finished [Wolfenstein: The Old Blood](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wolfenstein:_The_Old_Blood). I bought it in a bundle with Wolfenstein: The New Order on discount months ago. It took longer than expected but overall brought me a very good gaming experience. 

It reminded me of playing [Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfenstein/comments/37z799/is_the_old_blood_a_remake_of_return_spoilers/) back in the days. I was so terrified by the atmosphere that I entered the cheat code to play the entire campaign in god mode (and yet I was still scared to death). Now I can proudly(?) say that I finished the Old Blood in "Bring 'em On!" difficulty (though I cheated and turned down the difficulty when fighting the final boss because I lost patience).

Unlike the Call of Duty series, where there are clear battle lines and allied NPCs "helping" you, the new Wolfenstein series requires you to fight enemies from all directions. The constant need for 90 to 180 degree turns sometimes is nauseating for me. The best strategy I've seen used by Youtubers is to keep running around. Unfortunately, my eyesight does not allow me to do that effectively. So I mostly used silent approaches and open fire until I made sure that there won't be enemies flanking me.

Can be very stressful sometimes, but also very rewarding once you get past it. Highly recommended.
