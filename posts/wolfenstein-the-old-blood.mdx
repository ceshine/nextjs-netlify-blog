I finally finished [Wolfenstein: The Old Blood](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wolfenstein:_The_Old_Blood). I bought it in a bundle with Wolfenstein: The New Order on discount months ago. It took longer than expected but overall brought me a very good gaming experience. 

It reminded me of playing [Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfenstein/comments/37z799/is_the_old_blood_a_remake_of_return_spoilers/) back in the days. I was so terrified by the atmosphere that I entered the cheat code to play the entire campaign in god mode (and yet I was still scared to death). Now I can proudly(?) say that I finished the Old Blood in "Bring 'em On!" difficulty (though I cheated and turned down the difficulty when fighting the final boss because I lost patience).
